The project is a space game about resource trading. The resources fluctuate based on a randomly rotating stock market. The resources have a "elasticity" that effects how much their value relatively changes in a year, naturally going higher or lower than another resource might in that year. The price the resource was sold at in the last year will be different from the current year and the next year. Resources can be bought and sold at the nearby planets.

The plans for the future of the game are to add a local planet market resource value that scales the global resource values based on the demand and supply of the planet. We want to add factions that also influence the economy based on the views of the faction. There would be a upgradable development level on the planets that would allow the player to directly infleunce resource values on the developed planet. The ship should have upgrades that visually change it and increase the total resources it can hold, and along with that we would also add a cap to the resources the ship can hold at one time.
